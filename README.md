Component systems like React allow us to reuse HTML, and that ought to change the way we think about CSS selectors. We no longer need CSS to magically apply itself to many instances accross a project. Instead, we can create direct relationships between elements and their style properties.

One way to do so is to write inline style objects in React...

Atomic CSS means writing single-purpose classes and composing them at the point of use. You can read about the benefits of this approach at the links below:

- [Functional Programming, CSS, and your sanity](http://www.jon.gold/2015/07/functional-css/)
- [CSS and Scalability](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/)

[Basscss](http://basscss.com/) is a collection of classes suited to the atomic approach. It provides a strong toolkit and good documentation, but it probably won't provide everything you'll ever need or want from CSS. As you start to augment it with your own classes you run into some of the same problems it is meant to solve.
