Basscss should be a library, not a framework.

Atomic CSS means writing single-purpose classes and composing them at the point of use. You can read about the benefits of this approach at the links below:

- [Functional Programming, CSS, and your sanity](http://www.jon.gold/2015/07/functional-css/)
- [CSS and Scalability](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/)

These days we reuse HTML by utilizing component systems like React. We no longer need CSS to magically apply itself to many instances accross a project. Instead, we can create direct (one-to-one) relationships between element and style.

[Basscss](http://basscss.com/) is a collection of classes suited to the atomic approach. It provides a strong toolkit and good documentation, but it probably won't provide everything you'll ever need or want from CSS. As you start to augment it with your own classes you run into some of the same problems it is meant to solve.
